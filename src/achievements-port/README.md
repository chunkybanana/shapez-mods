# Achievements Lib v2

This is a library mod that allows mods to add their own achievements. It's
heavily modified from the original achievements mod by
[WaffleDevs](https://github.com/WaffleDevs/shapez-mods/tree/main/acheivements).

Documentation is in [docs.md](docs.md).

This mod comes bundled with a port of the vanilla achievements, along with a few
additional ones.
